# perspective: Higher kinded data in Scala 
perspective aims to provide many of the tools you need to program with HKD in Scala. 
Everything from deriving the categorical typeclasses themselves to deriving 
general typeclasses for ADTs using HKD instead of HLists as a backbone.

**NOTE: ** perspective is still **VERY** early in development, and is as such 
prone to changing a lot as I figure out the best ways to do stuff.

If you want a good primer for working with HKD, check out this blog post (TODO).
